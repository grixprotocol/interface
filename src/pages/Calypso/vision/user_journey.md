### User's Natural Language Guidance
{
  "agent_guidance": {
    "prompt": "I want to protect my ETH position from major downside risks while still generating some yield.

Please be conservative with strike selections and alert me of any significant changes.",
    "key_objectives": [

    "prompt": "I want to maximize yield on my BTC through aggressive options strategies. I'm comfortable with complex positions like iron condors and strangles. Target 25% APY but protect against tail risks. I want you to be dynamic - adjust strategies based on market conditions and be more aggressive in low volatility periods.
