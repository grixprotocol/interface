# Active Context

## Current Work
- Modified trade agents transformation logic in `utils.ts`
- Each signal request now generates a separate agent object
- Parent agent properties are shared across multiple agent objects
- Empty signal requests generate a single agent with default values

## Recent Changes
- Updated `transformBackendResponse` function to handle multiple signal requests per agent
- Each signal request now creates its own agent object with:
  - Shared properties from parent agent (id, name, status, etc.)
  - Individual settings from the signal request
  - Individual signals array from the request
- Empty signal requests generate a single agent with empty settings

## Next Steps
- Verify the new transformation logic works with all edge cases
- Consider adding request ID to differentiate between multiple instances of the same agent
- Consider adding UI elements to show relationship between agents from the same parent

## Current Focus Areas
- Documentation completeness
- System architecture documentation
- Development workflow documentation
- Project status tracking

## Active Tasks
1. Complete memory bank initialization
2. Verify all required documentation is in place
3. Ensure documentation reflects current project state
4. Set up documentation maintenance procedures

## Notes
- Documentation should be kept up to date
- Changes should be tracked in updates.md files
- Regular reviews needed to maintain accuracy

# Current Work Context

## Project: TradeAgentsV2 Implementation
- Improving and extending the trade agents section with new features while maintaining design consistency

### Current Focus
- Implementing design improvements from V1 into V2 while maintaining V2's UX benefits

### Feature Priority List
1. PnL integration
2. Share/notification functionality
3. Price history integration

### Implementation Strategy
- Keep V2's data structure and design system
- Reuse V1's feature implementations rather than rebuilding
- Maintain consistency with CalypsoHub design

### Progress
- Completed initial SignalCard design alignment
- Identified missing features from V1
- Started PnL integration planning

### Next Steps
1. Implement PnL section in SignalCard
   - Need full PnlSection component code
   - Need TradeAgentSignal type definition
   - Need related hooks and utilities

2. Plan share/notification integration
3. Plan price history integration

### Technical Notes
- V2 uses transformed data from utils.ts
- Need to ensure compatibility between V1 and V2 data structures
- Maintaining type safety throughout integration

## Planned Changes (Prioritized)
1. Navigation Enhancement
   - Hybrid system with sidebar and tabs
   - Status: Not started

2. Visual Design Refinement
   - Adopt V1's styling while keeping V2's structure
   - Status: Not started

3. Layout Structure
   - Incorporate V1's spacing and grid
   - Status: Not started

4. Data Visualization Enhancement
   - Apply V1's polish to V2's components
   - Status: Not started

5. Action Patterns Refinement
   - Enhance interaction patterns
   - Status: Not started

## Next Steps
- Begin with Navigation Enhancement implementation
- Await confirmation to proceed

## Recent Updates

- Updated the Signal type in src/pages/CalypsoHub/components/agentsSection/tradeAgentsV2/types.ts to exactly match the API response. 
  - Now, the Signal type has a nested 'signal' object with the following keys (all in snake_case):
    - size: number
    - reason: string
    - instrument: string
    - action_type: 'open' | 'close'
    - position_type: 'long' | 'short'
    - instrument_type: 'option' | 'asset'
    - target_position_id: string | null
    - expected_total_price_usd: number
    - expected_instrument_price_usd: number
  - The outer Signal object now uses created_at and updated_at as provided by the API response.

- Removed the transformSignal function, as we no longer need to transform the API response; we now use the API response directly.

## Next Steps

- Validate the integration of the new Signal type within UI components such as SignalsList and SignalCard.
- Perform end-to-end testing to ensure that signals are displayed correctly across the application.
